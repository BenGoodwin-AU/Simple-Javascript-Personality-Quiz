            <p>The Witcher series is most often known around its two main forms of media; the book series by Andrzej Sapkowski and the video game series by CD Projekt. The series is set inside a fantasy medieval world on the landmass known simply as The Continent.

In additon to witchers, there are dwarves; dragons and castles; mages (known as sorcerers) and sorceresses. </p>
